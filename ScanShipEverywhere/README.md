# Scan Ship Everywhere Mod

Despite the name, this mod allows you to scan many things from pretty much anywhere on the map.<br>

Things you can scan:<br>

- Ship
- Drop Ship (Compatible with other mods)
- Main Entrance
- Fire Exits (If a mod adds a scan node to them)
- Light Switch (Compatible with other mods. Only inside ship, of course)

This mod works by just setting the maxRange for these scan nodes to a very high number.<br>
It also increases the hard max distance for scan nodes.<br>

But... There's already [this mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/DBJ/ShipScanRange/) doing the same
thing!<br>
Yes, but this mod ignores the hard max distance problem.<br>
Also, it does not provide a config in case you just want to set your own limits.<br>

## Potential issues:<br>

- If a mod adds scan nodes to the entrance/fire exit inside the facility, this might cause issues

## Known incompatibilities:<br>

- None

## Compatible Scan-Overriding mods:<br>
